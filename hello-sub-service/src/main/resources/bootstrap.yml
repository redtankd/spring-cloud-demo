spring.application.name: HelloSubService

# Having spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client on the classpath
# makes the app into both a Eureka “instance” (that is, it registers itself)
# and a “client” (it can query the registry to locate other services).
# The instance behaviour is driven by eureka.instance.* configuration keys,
# but the defaults are fine if you ensure that your application has a value
# for spring.application.name (this is the default for the Eureka service ID or VIP).

# See EurekaInstanceConfigBean and EurekaClientConfigBean for more details
# on the configurable options.
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/

# discover the config server through Eureka server
spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled: true
