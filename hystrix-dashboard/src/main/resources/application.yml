# Hystrix Dashboard read metrics in three ways
# 1. read through /hystrix.stream directly
# 2. Turbine, read through /turbine.stream which pulls metrics from /hystrix.stream
# 3. Turbine Stream, Hystrix commands push metrics to Turbine

# Turbine is an application that aggregates all of the relevant
# /hystrix.stream endpoints into a combined /turbine.stream
# for use in the Hystrix Dashboard.

  # services to monitor, by looking up in Eureka

# Having spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client on the classpath
# makes the app into both a Eureka “instance” (that is, it registers itself)
# and a “client” (it can query the registry to locate other services).
# The instance behaviour is driven by eureka.instance.* configuration keys,
# but the defaults are fine if you ensure that your application has a value
# for spring.application.name (this is the default for the Eureka service ID or VIP).

# See EurekaInstanceConfigBean and EurekaClientConfigBean for more details
# on the configurable options.
